Multistate public information requests
======
The **multistate-public-information-request-language-samples** repository will hopefully be a bunch of (mostly) successful requests -- that is, requests that give me back most of what I'm looking for. I leave unsuccessful ones out to avoid wasting others' time, though you're welcome to scour agency FOIA logs to find them :)

**Partial list of TODOs:**

It may pay in future to extend the chronological range of queries forward a bit (if it hasn't already been done -- some queries have this feature already, while others don't). Even partial yearly data is useful if it allows us to track changes in the mere presence of something -- an employee name on a list, for example, which moves our analysis of departures forward by a year.
